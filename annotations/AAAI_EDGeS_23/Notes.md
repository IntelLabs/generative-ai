# Notes on annotation

The annotations were done using the prompts in pd230228. Note that some images in the annotations file are listed with "pd230208" in the filename instead of "pd230228". Due to issues with Dalle's security filter when rendering the directed action prompts and an error in generating the controlled multiple object counting prompts, we had to update the prompt directory during the data annotation process. We made sure that the order of all other prompts stayed the same, so that one can safely use the "pd230228" prompt directory as reference when analysing the annotation results
