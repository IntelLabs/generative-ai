# Notes on annotation
These analyses were run in the "annotation_analysis230322" environment.

## Extra variables variables in prompt directory
For the analysis of annotations we make use of additional variables describing the prompts. These were extracted during the creation and can be used for any other annotation analysis based on the pd230228 prompt directory.

## Published reports of this data
The results presented here discussed in the AAAI Spring Symposium '23 (EDGeS) paper. The link to the paper will be added shortly.

## Clarification on file names
The annotations were done using the prompts in pd230228. Note that some images in the annotations file are listed with "pd230208" in the filename instead of "pd230228". Due to issues with Dalle's security filter when rendering the directed action prompts and an error in generating the controlled multiple object counting prompts, we had to update the prompt directory during the data annotation process. We made sure that the order of all other prompts stayed the same, so that one can safely use the "pd230228" prompt directory as reference when analysing the annotation results
